# freq-convert
Code for frequency conversion processes in nonlinear microresonators.  
This code was written to analyze the dynamical and steady state behavior of various frequency mixing processes
in nonlinear microresonators.  For example, one process that we are interested in is difference frequency generation
from visible to telecom.  What coupling parameters should we use in order to have the highest efficiencies? What role
does temperature play? What should the transmission spectrum look like?
